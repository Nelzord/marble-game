=======================================

To create the Gold marble texture in Roblox Studio:

1. In the Gold folder, create a new Texture instance
2. Set the Texture property to: rbxassetid://84142305330257
3. Set the Face property to: Front (or leave as default for all faces)
4. Set StudsPerTileU and StudsPerTileV to: 1

Alternatively, you can create a Decal instance:
1. Create a new Decal instance
2. Set the Texture property to: rbxassetid://84142305330257

This will make the Gold marble appear with the correct golden, metallic texture.
