Jumper Marble Texture Setup Instructions
========================================

To create the Jumper marble texture in Roblox Studio:

1. In the Jumper folder, create a new Texture instance
2. Set the Texture property to: rbxassetid://81030833444551
3. Set the Face property to: Front (or leave as default for all faces)
4. Set StudsPerTileU and StudsPerTileV to: 1

Alternatively, you can create a Decal instance:
1. Create a new Decal instance
2. Set the Texture property to: rbxassetid://81030833444551
3. Set the Face property to: Front (or leave as default for all faces)

The texture ID is: rbxassetid://81030833444551

This will make the Jumper marble appear with the correct orange jumping-themed texture.
