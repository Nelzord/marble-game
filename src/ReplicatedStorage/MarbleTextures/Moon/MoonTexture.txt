===================

This file contains the texture information for the Moon Marble.

Texture Details:
- Base Color: Light gray/silver (RGB: 200, 200, 220)
- Material: Slightly metallic with subtle moon-like surface
- Pattern: Smooth with subtle craters and moon surface details
- Glow Effect: Soft white/blue glow when ability is active

The Moon Marble provides:
- Lower gravity for floating, lunar-like movement
- Slower falling and jumping (same distance, slower speed)
- Passive ability (always active when equipped)
- Visual glow effect when active

This marble is perfect for players who want to experience low-gravity movement, simulating the reduced gravity environment of the moon where everything moves slower but covers the same distances.
