Glass Marble Texture Setup Instructions
=======================================

To create the Glass marble texture in Roblox Studio:

1. In the Glass folder, create a new Texture instance
2. Set the Texture property to: rbxassetid://105354663033089
3. Set the Face property to: Front (or leave as default for all faces)
4. Set StudsPerTileU and StudsPerTileV to: 1

Alternatively, you can create a Decal instance:
1. Create a new Decal instance
2. Set the Texture property to: rbxassetid://105354663033089
3. Set the Face property to: Front (or leave as default for all faces)

The texture ID is: rbxassetid://105354663033089

This will make the Glass marble appear with the correct glassy, crystalline texture.

Glass Marble Details:
- Base Color: Light blue glass (RGB: 220, 240, 255)
- Material: Glass with high reflectance and transparency
- Pattern: Smooth glass surface with subtle reflections
- Glow Effect: Cool blue glow when ability is active

The Glass Marble provides:
- Leaves behind a connected glass trail while moving that makes marbles slip and slide
- 6-second duration for each glass tile in the trail
- No cooldown - passive trail ability that activates while moving
- Visual glass particles and sparkle effects
- Affects all marbles that touch any glass tile in the trail
- Only creates glass tiles when moving above minimum speed threshold
- Maximum of 20 glass tiles in trail at once

This marble is perfect for players who want to leave behind slippery glass trails that affect movement, making it harder for other players to maintain control while following their path.
