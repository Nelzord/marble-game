Spider Marble Texture Setup Instructions

To create the Spider marble texture in Roblox Studio:

1. In the Spider folder, create a new Texture instance
2. Set the Texture property to: rbxassetid://105354663033087
3. Set the Face property to: Front (or leave as default for all faces)
4. Set StudsPerTileU and StudsPerTileV to: 1

Alternatively, you can create a Decal instance:
1. Create a new Decal instance
2. Set the Texture property to: rbxassetid://105354663033087
3. Set the Face property to: Front (or leave as default for all faces)

The texture ID is: rbxassetid://105354663033087

This will make the Spider marble appear with the correct spider-like texture.
