# MarbleGame
Generated by [Rojo](https://github.com/rojo-rbx/rojo) 7.5.1.

## Getting Started
To build the place from scratch, use:

```bash
rojo build -o "MarbleGame.rbxlx"
```

Next, open `MarbleGame.rbxlx` in Roblox Studio and start the Rojo server:

```bash
rojo serve
```

## Testing Features

### Debug Mode: All Marbles
For testing purposes, you can enable a debug flag that automatically gives all marbles to players when they join the game. This allows you to test all marble abilities without having to roll for them.

To enable this feature:
1. Open `src/ServerScriptService/MarbleService.server.luau`
2. Set `GIVE_ALL_MARBLES = true` (it's enabled by default)
3. Set to `false` to disable this feature in production

When enabled, you'll see a console message: `[MarbleService] DEBUG MODE: All marbles will be given to players automatically`
