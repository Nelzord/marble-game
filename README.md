## Testing Features

### Debug Mode: All Marbles
For testing purposes, you can enable a debug flag that automatically gives all marbles to players when they join the game. This allows you to test all marble abilities without having to roll for them.

To enable this feature:
1. Open `src/ServerScriptService/MarbleService.server.luau`
2. Set `GIVE_ALL_MARBLES = true` (it's enabled by default)
3. Set to `false` to disable this feature in production

When enabled, you'll see a console message: `[MarbleService] DEBUG MODE: All marbles will be given to players automatically`

### Debug Mode: Give Coins
For testing purposes, you can enable a debug flag that automatically gives 500 coins to players when they join the game. This allows you to test coin-related features without having to collect coins.

To enable this feature:
1. Open `src/ServerScriptService/CoinService.luau`
2. Set `GIVE_COINS = true` (it's enabled by default)
3. Set to `false` to disable this feature in production

When enabled, you'll see a console message: `[CoinService] DEBUG MODE: Players will receive 500 coins automatically`
